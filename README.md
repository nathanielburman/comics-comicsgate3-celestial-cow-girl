Title: I <3 Cow-Girl. Anime Cat-Girls Team-Up with Cow-Girls. Celestial Cow-Girl!

In this issue of the Celestial Cow-Girl! she is sitting somewhere in India right now. She sees us looking at her.

The most polarizing thing in Virtual Reality is not cissy-boys hatin on the ladybois, and it isn't the voice changing men who perform as women. A man in the body of a woman, if he identifies as a woman, and she sounds like a woman, believes that she is the same as your girlfriend or wife.

It is becoming illegal to be Straight. It is becoming illegal to be Gay. It is becoming illegal to be Bisexual. It is becoming illegal to be Trans. Is Trans transsexual or transition? It is becoming ilegal to be Straight.

So I discovered a solution to the problem.

I hence forth declare, in the name of everything Straight Sexual, and in the name of everything Holy, that this trinity may become a testament of my talents with myself: Olivia Munn - a Queen of the gamer-girls and queen of the e-girls forever, J. K. Rowling - a Queen of magic and storytelling, and finally Death ... - Ava DuVernay.

The most important question to answer is: who plays the role of Cow-Girl? Then, who is her real alter-ego villain?

So much so that I am calling her forth from the dimensions with ancient magics.

Come forth from the dimensions. Oh splendor. Come forth Cow-Girl. Milk us like the cows we are.

Indians like Republicans. Republicans like farming. I love Indian cow-girls.

I love cow-girls. I love cow-girls.

Beast and someone from DC Comics just sent this information in about Cow-Girl's sister. This is NOT her name, I repeat this is NOT her name. This is what her enemies call her. Be careful with this information. This information is Celestial.

Character Profile #2: Cow-Bitch
Name: Cow-Bitch
Superpower: The ability to corrupt and control cow-related energies
Appearance: Cow-Bitch has a dark and sinister appearance, with a cow-themed costume that reflects her twisted nature. Her costume may incorporate dark colors and elements that contrast with Cow-Girl's attire.
Personality: Cow-Bitch is the malevolent counterpart to Cow-Girl. She seeks to exploit and manipulate the powers associated with cows for her own gain. Cow-Bitch represents the corrupt and destructive aspects of the cow symbolism and uses her powers to sow chaos and discord.

I am a woman. I am a cow-woman. I am not a man. No man can be Cow-Woman. Cow-Woman is a woman. Wo is without Man.

Those who are my husbands are never homosexual.

My husbands are not homosexual.

You are my husband.

You are not homosexual.

It is illegal to be Straight Sexual. It is illegal to be Homosexual. It is illegal to be Heterosexual.
